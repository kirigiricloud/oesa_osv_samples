    "summary": "python-h11 security update",
    "details": "h11 is suitable for implementing both servers and clients, and has a pleasantly symmetric API: the events you send as a client are exactly the ones that you receive as a server and vice-versa.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nh11 is a Python implementation of HTTP/1.1. Prior to version 0.16.0, a leniency in h11&apos;s parsing of line terminators in chunked-coding message bodies can lead to request smuggling vulnerabilities under certain conditions. This issue has been patched in version 0.16.0. Since exploitation requires the combination of buggy h11 with a buggy (reverse) proxy, fixing either component is sufficient to mitigate this issue.(CVE-2025-43859)",
