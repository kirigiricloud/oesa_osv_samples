    "details": "Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser, designed for standards compliance, performance and portability.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nThunderbird&apos;s update mechanism allowed a medium-integrity user process to interfere with the SYSTEM-level updater by manipulating the file-locking behavior. By injecting code into the user-privileged process, an attacker could bypass intended access controls, allowing SYSTEM-level file operations on paths controlled by a non-privileged user and enabling privilege escalation. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 138, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.10, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.23, Thunderbird &lt; 138, and Thunderbird &lt; 128.10.(CVE-2025-2817)\n\nA process isolation vulnerability in Thunderbird stemmed from improper handling of javascript: URIs, which could allow content to execute in the top-level document&apos;s process instead of the intended frame, potentially enabling a sandbox escape. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 138, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.10, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.23, Thunderbird &lt; 138, and Thunderbird &lt; 128.10.(CVE-2025-4083)\n\nDue to insufficient escaping of the special characters in the &quot;copy as cURL&quot; feature, an attacker could trick a user into using this command, potentially leading to local code execution on the user&apos;s system.\n*This bug only affects Firefox for Windows. Other versions of Firefox are unaffected.* This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR &lt; 128.10, Firefox ESR &lt; 115.23, and Thunderbird &lt; 128.10.(CVE-2025-4084)\n\nA vulnerability was identified in Thunderbird where XPath parsing could trigger undefined behavior due to missing null checks during attribute access. This could lead to out-of-bounds read access and potentially, memory corruption. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 138, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.10, Thunderbird &lt; 138, and Thunderbird &lt; 128.10.(CVE-2025-4087)\n\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 137, Thunderbird 137, Firefox ESR 128.9, and Thunderbird 128.9. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox &lt; 138, Firefox ESR &lt; 128.10, Thunderbird &lt; 138, and Thunderbird &lt; 128.10.(CVE-2025-4091)\n\nMemory safety bug present in Firefox ESR 128.9, and Thunderbird 128.9. This bug showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort this could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR &lt; 128.10 and Thunderbird &lt; 128.10.(CVE-2025-4093)",
