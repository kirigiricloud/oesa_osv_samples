    "details": "Perl 5 is a highly capable, feature-rich programming language with over 30 years of development. Perl 5 runs on over 100 platforms from portables to mainframes and is suitable for both rapid prototyping and large scale development projects.\r\n\r\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nA heap buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in Perl. \n\nRelease branches 5.34, 5.36, 5.38 and 5.40 are affected, including development versions from 5.33.1 through 5.41.10.\n\nWhen there are non-ASCII bytes in the left-hand-side of the `tr` operator, `S_do_trans_invmap` can overflow the destination pointer `d`.\n\n   $ perl -e &apos;$_ = &quot;\\x{FF}&quot; x 1000000; tr/\\xFF/\\x{100}/;&apos; \n   Segmentation fault (core dumped)\n\nIt is believed that this vulnerability can enable Denial of Service and possibly Code Execution attacks on platforms that lack sufficient defenses.(CVE-2024-56406)",
